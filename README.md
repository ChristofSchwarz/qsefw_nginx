# Using NGINX in front of Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows

NGINX (pronounced "Engine X") is a web server and reverse proxy, load balancer and more. NGINX is free and open-source 
software and has become extremely popular. In Feb 2020, estimated Netcraft, NGIX served over 36% of all active websites (!!).

We will use it "in front of" our Windows Qlik Sense Server to expose other services (maybe a self-written one like my Qlik
Sense LDAP Login https://github.com/ChristofSchwarz/qsefw_ldap_login or Qlik's QPS API), which typically run on other ports 
than 443, as a route.

By default, the https port 443 is taken by Qlik Sense Proxy Service already, so we have to move it to another port. We can 
also enable http traffic internally between NGINX and Qlik Sense.

Follow these steps
 - Log into Qlik Sense QMC, Proxies settings on https://localhost/qmc/proxies
 - Edit the Central Proxy
 - Go to "Ports" section of the page and change it like this:

| Note: after that port change in the QMC, you can (unless NGINX is installed later) no more reach the QMC or Hub under https://localhost/ but either under https://localhost:444/ or http://localhost |

 - Download nginx Stable Version for Windows from http://nginx.org/en/download.html
 - Extract all files into a new folder e.g. `C:\nginx`
 - Download the [/conf/nginx.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristofSchwarz/qsefw_nginx/master/conf/nginx.conf) file and overwrite the default file in your local installation on `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf`


## Run NGINX from Command Prompt

To see if any errors will occur, open an elevated Command Prompt (as Administrator) and go to your NGINX folder.
Run `nginx.exe`. It will pick the default config file from /conf/nginx.conf ... 

 - If you see no errors, you are all set.
 - To stop nginx again, there is no Ctrl+C or other keyboard combination. You have to start Task Manager in Windows
 - Kill two NGINX processes (it always runs with 2 processes at least) from Task Manager
 - Then you will get the prompt again in your Command Prompt window
 
## Making NGINX a Windows Service using NSSM

Although NSSM ("Non-sucking Service Manager") is old and hasn't seen updates for a while, it is what it is: 
An amazingly light-weight executeable that you run **once** in order to register a given .exe (nginx.exe) as 
a Windows Service. After you do that, you will be able to start/stop and auto-start NGINX as a Service and
don't need NSSM again.

 - Download nssm.exe from http://nssm.cc and save the Win64 version of nssm.exe somewhere in the nginx folder e.g. in `C:\nginx\nssm\nssm.exe` (alternatively get the Win64 version straight from [this repository](https://github.com/ChristofSchwarz/qsefw_nginx/raw/master/nssm/nssm.exe))
 - Run an elevated Command Prompt (run as Administrator) 
 - Execute this command: `C:\nginx\nssm\nssm.exe install`
 - Set the parameters on the first page of NSSM. The other settings can be as default or change if you know what you are doing.

 - Use the "Services" window to start the new NGINX service or simply type `net start NGINX` from your open command prompt

### uninstalling NGINX service

 - Run an elevated Command Prompt (run as Administrator)
 - Stop the NGINX Service in Windows or type `net stop "NGINX"` in the command prompt
 - Execute this command: `C:\nginx\nssm\nssm.exe remove NGINX`

## Understand the settings for Qlik Sense on Windows

In this nginx.conf we are routing everything to http://localhost, so any path like /hub, /qmc, /sense, ... will end up on 
port 80. But to the outside world, the nginx should use certificates and https. For sake of simplicity, I am reusing the
certificates server.pem and server_key.pem that Qlik Sense has created during installation and saved to 
`C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Repository\Exported Certificates\.Local Certificates`

Note: It is not necessary to introduce a separate Virtual Proxy to have a main parent path after the host name in your url.


## Exposing QPS API on https as route /api/qps

The QPS API of Qlik Sense listens to port 4243 and requires the Client Certificate (client.pem) and Client Certificate Key 
(client_key.pem) to be presented. Both, the port and the availability of the certificate files, can be a burden. With the 
help of NGINX we are going to present the certificates internally, while the QPS API itself will be exposed under the route
/api/qps on the default https port 443.

### Secure route /api/qps with basic authentication

NGINX is able to secure certain paths for which it is proxy. We would like to expose Qlik's QPS API under route /api/qps but 
use at least a basic authentication with username+password. See https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-http-basic-authentication/

Copy the [userpasswords.txt](conf/userpasswords.txt) file to your `C:\nginx\conf` folder. It contains already one user "api1" + 
password "Qlik1234" which you should change to another combination. You can create line entries using the [Online htpassword Generator](https://www.web2generators.com/apache-tools/htpasswd-generator)

### Example: Request Ticket for User using route /api/qps

Here we are using the route and we post the Basic Authentication encoded as Base64 Bit 
 - to get the Base64 encoded combination for your apiuser and password (which you set up in userpasswords.txt file before) 
 - try https://www.base64encode.org/ and enter "api1:Qlik1234" (change accordingly)
 - open Browser Console with F12 and type the JavaScript function `btoa("api1:Qlik1234")` (change accordingly)
 - you will get a string like `YXBpMTpRbGlrMTIzNA==` 

The simpliest call to QPS API is a GET "about"
```
curl --location --request GET 'https://qmi-qs-sn/api/qps/about/description?xrfkey=1234567890123456' \
--header 'X-Qlik-Xrfkey: 1234567890123456' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YXBpMTpRbGlrMTIzNA==' \
```

This is a POST call to get a ticket

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://qmi-qs-sn/api/qps/ticket?xrfkey=0123456789ABCDEF' \
--header 'X-Qlik-Xrfkey: 0123456789ABCDEF' \
--header 'X-Qlik-User: UserDirectory=Internal;UserId=sa_proxy' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic YXBpMTpRbGlrMTIzNA==' \
--data-raw '{
  "UserDirectory": "DOMAIN",
  "UserId": "myuser",
  "Attributes": []
}'
```
